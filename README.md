Random Forests and Multi-class AdaBoost for Wine and MNIST datasets 
1. Wine dataset:  2 types of RFs, one in which each of the decision trees is grown to the full extent, and the other in which the maximum tree depth is 5
2. MNIST dataset: 2 types of RFs, one in which each of the decision trees is grown to the full extent, and the other in which the maximum tree depth is 5; Multi-class AdaBoost for 0, 1, 3 and 5
